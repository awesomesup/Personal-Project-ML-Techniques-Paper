## Project Description 

This project was done by me for my machine learning class at UCSD.

I used 5 different machine learning techniques on 4 large databases from UC Irvine to compare how each technique did based on the type of data.

I then wrote a comprehensive paper with detailed description of the experiments conducted.

The paper can be viewed [here](https://awesomesup.github.io/Personal-Project-ML-Techniques-Paper/Sup_Learn%20algorithms%20comparison%20paper.pdf).
